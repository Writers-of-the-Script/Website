**Day B** is an infinitely generating set of rooms made of protected void blocks. The rooms are three blocks tall, and the floor and ceiling are two blocks thick. Lights are unevenly placed, making it dark in some areas- although no mobs or entities can spawn.

In certain rooms, it is possible to find purple console blocks that can be interacted with via text prompts. It is currently unknown what purpose these consoles serve.

As the only known way into this dimension is to teleport yourself with commands, it is currently unknown how to get there and how long it takes to be teleported back out.

## Small Console Room

A small room blocked by protected void doors, containing 3 consoles on pedestals. Sometimes there is a void light in the ceiling, but this seems to be a rare generation.

The consoles aren't any different from the typical console block, and don't yield any different responses.

## Pillar Room

A room that usually connects empty rooms and small console rooms, full of pillars and narrow, one block paths between them. In the middle of this room there is a console on a pedestal, surrounded by a 2 block high wall with a one block wide entrance.

## Large Room

A large room with no unique structures inside, often splitting into small hallways that lead to one of the other two room types. Lights are unevenly placed, leading to some areas being dark.
