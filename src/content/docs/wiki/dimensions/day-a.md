Day A is a dimension consisting of two layers, for the sake of simplicity here referred to as upper and lower.

The upper layer resembles superflat world, with growing grass and oak trees. It is possible to find floating islands not high from the surface, which are made of chiseled stone bricks and dirt. Under the first layer of grass there is immediately bedrock, separating the two layers.

Player-like entities with a black skin seem to be able to spawn in the shadows. They are neutral and disappear when approached.

The lower layer is a full-fledged terrain, consisting of dirt, chiseled stone bricks instead of stone, and quartz blocks seemingly instead of water.
