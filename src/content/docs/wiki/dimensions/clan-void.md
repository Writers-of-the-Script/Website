title: Clan Void
---

**Clan Void** is a dimension in the broken script that is composed of a
seemingly infinite amount of almost identical rooms, although each room is
different in some way. There is a total of 8 variations of the same room. Each
room is composed of cobblestone walls, smooth stone blocks for the floor and a
passage on each side. A way out of the Clan Void dimension are **white blocks**
that can be found randomly in the dimension. The white blocks spawn in one of
the rooms, where every space is filled with them. There is an old version of
this dimension before the _1.9 update_ where the dimension instead was a
maze-like medium with a cobblestone roof and floor as well as cobblestone walls
and pillars; to leave this version, players had to wait a few minutes to get
teleported back out.
