title: Clan Void
---

**Clan Void** is a dimension in the broken script that is composed of a seemingly infinite amount of almost identical rooms, although each room is different in some way. There is a total of 8 variations of the same room. Each room is composed of cobblestone walls, smooth stone blocks for the floor and a passage on each side. A way out of the Clan Void dimension are **white blocks** that can be found randomly in the dimension. The white blocks spawn in one of the rooms, where every space is filled with them. There is an old version of this dimension before the *1.9 update* where the dimension instead was a maze-like medium with a cobblestone roof and floor as well as cobblestone walls and pillars; to leave this version, players had to wait a few minutes to get teleported back out.
