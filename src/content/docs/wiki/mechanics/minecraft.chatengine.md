title: minecraft.chatengine
---

Certain entity encounters cause Minecraft's chat engine to fail,
preventing chat messages from being sent and causing the following error
messages:

> `IMPORT minecraft.chatengine` \
> `Unexpected_error.returnedvalue=-1`

What is understood about this error is that it has occurred on the
"*server*" before, as the previous players left a sign in an old
[clan_build](/wiki/structures/clan-build), commenting then, "Why chat won’t
work?".

The following entities are currently known to be able to do this:

- [The Broken End](/wiki/entities/tbe)
- [r2](/wiki/entities/r2)
