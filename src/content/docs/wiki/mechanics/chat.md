title: Chat Interactions
---

In the 1.8 version of [The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs) it was required for the
players to be within a certain vicinity of [Null](/wiki/entities/null) watching
to interact with him. It no longer seems to be the case in version 1.9. There
are seemingly no conditions and responses are based off what the player says in
chat.

The following interactions are capable of taking place, and are arranged in a
table. Expand the table at your own risk, as it contains heavy spoilers.
