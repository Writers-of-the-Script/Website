title: Chat Interactions
---

In the 1.8 version of [The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs) it was required for the players to be
within a certain vicinity of [Null](/wiki/entities/null) watching to interact with him. It no longer
seems to be the case in version 1.9. There are seemingly no conditions and
responses are based off what the player says in chat.

The following interactions are capable of taking place, and are arranged in a
table. Expand the table at your own risk, as it contains heavy spoilers.
