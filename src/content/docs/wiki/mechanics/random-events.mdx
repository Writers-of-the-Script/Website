import CaptionedAudio from "../../../../components/CaptionedAudio.astro";

In [The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs), Random events may
occur to the player or the world around the player. These events are
anonymous in nature with no real rhyme or reason to them, some of them
are rather innocuous, maybe some even helpful, meanwhile others maybe
openly malicious.

What is listed here is a collection of of events that has been
documented thus far.

## List of Events

### Lava

A lava block source is placed on player's base to sabotage their home.

### Ghost blocks Area

It will replace all blocks at the players location, in a square of
19x19x19 with invisible blocks you slowly sink through. Stepping inside
causes you to get stuck as if they were cobwebs, their behaviour is
pretty strange, it can cause you to drop from the block randomly, you
will also jitter a little bit when you're inside, stepping outside onto
air, then hitting something stores the fall damage (about 3 hearts)
breaking one of the blocks will make it drop the block it originally
was. the blocks also lag behind once being broken, taking about 5
seconds to actually drop, in that space of time you can mine it over and
over again.
