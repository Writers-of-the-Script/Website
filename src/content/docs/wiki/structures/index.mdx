Structures in The Broken Script are builds that randomly spawn around
the world after some time. They will spawn in loaded chunks around the
player, sometimes in front of their very eyes, and can range from some
signs and fenceposts to entire clan bases and builds.

There are approximately 98(?) structures in the mod, but a portion of
them are for loading the custom dimensions.

Some structures are harmless, some are helpful, and some are designed to
hurt or trick the player. Some structures contain void blocks that send
the player to other dimensions.

It is possible for structures to spawn in or on top of player builds,
destroying the original build. If the builds in your world are important
to you, it is possible to turn off random structures with the mod's
config menu. One of our community members has spent the time to document
every single structure inside of TBS through his client and displayed
them in a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/Y16vdetFVH8).

# List of Structures

## Server Structures

### Clan Build

[Clan Build](/wiki/structures/clan-build) is a large, 5 story build (6 if you
include the roof) made of cobblestone and smooth stone. Signs found on
each floor indicate that this base used to belong to the [0nullvoid0's Clan](/wiki/lore#xxram2diexxs-clan) before the void entities began
to wreak destruction.

- The base contains chests filled entirely with missing texture items
  called name.null. They disappear from the inventory upon being used
  by the player and otherwise serve little purpose.
- Each floor has signs dated between 2018 and 2019, hinting at the
  [Lore](/wiki/lore) behind the base, and the Clan that lived in
  it.
- The 5th floor of the base contains void blocks that will teleport
  the player to the clan void when touched. They cannot be broken
  normally, but can be harvested with water and placed down elsewhere.
  All signs on this floor are dated 00.00.0000.
- The roof of the base has more signs and a circle of Redstone torches
  that serve an unknown purpose.

### Cave Base

Cave Base is another clan base belonging to
[Blackout's Clan](/wiki/lore) that can spawn in
loaded chunks underground. Due to the nature of its spawning and the way
The Broken Script affects cave generation, a minimap mod or large scale
excavation is often required to find it naturally.

- The base has 8 rooms - 1 "clan rules" room, 3 rooms belonging to one
  of the players, 2 storage rooms, a portal room, and a room
  containing a block of protected void.
- A jukebox in one of the storage rooms contains Record 14, with
  another in the adjacent chest. All other chests in the base are
  filled entirely with name.null.

### Wooden Starter Base

A 6 by 7 block wooden starter base, containing a crafting table, two
furnaces, a double chest and a white bed. The chest contains items such
as iron, wooden tools and cooked food- though exact item numbers can
vary. The furnaces contain a small amount of coal, and occasionally some
cooked food.

### Crafting Table

A lonely crafting table standing on the ground. What did they need to
craft so urgently? Or is this the beginning of this story?

### Scouting Towers

Scouting Towers, sometimes called "Dirt/Sand/Stone Pillars" is a classic
contraption with the sole purpose of looking around the area from a
bird's-eye view.

It is very common to see these regularly in normal Minecraft multiplayer
servers, however, they aren't as popular as they were back when the game
was still being fairly unexplored.

These Towers come in Sand and Dirt form, always being topped off with a
torch on top.

Thankfully, the Towers are shorter than their authentic counterpart
(15-20 blocks up), so they can be easily removed if necessary.

### Failed Aether Portal Frame

## Signs

### Signs

There is a chance of a oak sign being spawned with text on it. They
often range from cryptic messages from heartfelt comments about your
house (example; "Nice house" sign). While it is unclear who wrote these
signs, it still makes it slightly clear that not everything wants to
_harm_ you.

Sadly, placing a sign with a response yields no results.

### Sign Abomination

A small clump of fences and signs with some reading: A0, C0, B0,

## Anomalies

### Nether brick lava source

### Gore Structure

The Gore Structure is a small wooden build lit by redstone torches, and
made entirely from oak logs and planks. Inside is a chest that contains
[name.revuxor](/wiki/items#namerevuxor) items, and in the middle
of those is a book and quill. The book and quill contains the following
binary code inside, which translates into:

```
> 01000100 01101111 01101110 00100111 01110100 00100000 01101100
> 01101001 01110011 01110100 01100101 01101110 00100000 01110100
> 01101111 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 01101101 00100000
> 00111101 00101001

> Don't listen to them =)
```

### Carcas

Wooden Frame is a frame of oak logs, featuring a chest hidden in the
middle joint of the structure.

The chest contains redstone dust, glowstone dust, and a book and quill.
Book and Quill reads:

> Why are you still there?
>
> Is there is something you are looking for?

### **Trap house**

The trap house is made primarily of wood, with mossy stone edges. It has
two rooms; the first room contains a torch in each corner, while the
second has numerous redstone torches on the walls and a double chest
with no contents. If the player opens this chest, two TNTs will
activate.
