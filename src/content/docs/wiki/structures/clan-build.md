Clan Build is a large, 5 story build made of cobblestone and smooth stone. It
was built by the [0nullvoid0's Clan](/wiki/lore#xxram2diexxs-clan) and used as a
home and base for its [members](/wiki/lore#members).

## 1st Floor

### Hallway

Along the entire length of the corridor, a path of oak planks runs along the
floor. The right path leads to a glass-enclosed decoration, which is a kind of
fountain of flowing lava. The left path leads to the stairs to the outside of
the 2nd floor.

### DyeXD412's room

The room belonging to DyeXD412. On the left side of the entrance is a double red
bed. After it are 5 double chests with signs labeled "wood", "stone", "mob
loot", "items" and "misc", all filled with name.null, one in each slot.

Next to them in the corner of the room is an anvil, and against the wall is an
enchanting table, surrounded by 16 bookshelves with cobblestone slabs on 7 of
them.

On the right side of the entrance are two furnaces, the first with name.null and
13 coal, and the second with name.null and 17 coal. After them is a crafting
table.

In the center of the room is an old-style carpet made of orange and yellow wool
in a checkered pattern.

### Empty room

An empty room that could be rented for 1 iron per day.

### Animals

2 pens, enclosed by oak fences.

The floor of the 2nd pen is made of grass blocks, and in front of the sign in
memory of jagerooo stands a single red tulip.

### Pool

The pool is a room with a water pool enclosed by glass. On the left side, there
are 2 blocks of dirt apart from each other, and in the lower left corner of the
room, there is a chest with a fishing rod with 36/64 durability inside.

The pool is separated from the hall by a 3x3 room.

## 2nd Floor

### Outside

### Clan storage 1

## 3rd Floor

Two player rooms are found here. The one on the right is xXram2dieXx's room,
formerly 0nullvoid0, and the one on the left is WHYER4's room.

## 4th Floor

## 5th Floor

Originally, observed in [WORLD2](/wiki/lore/world2) to be the Nether Portal
room, it is no longer that. Corrupted blocks called "It" litter the room like
the signs scattered about it. Where the Nether Portal once was, is the Clan_Void
teleportation block called, "431434". Something foul seemed to have occurred
here, but the signs do not help make sense of the situation witnessed here.
