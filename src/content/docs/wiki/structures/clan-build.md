Clan Build is a large, 5 story build made of cobblestone and smooth
stone. It was built by the [0nullvoid0's
Clan](Lore#0nullvoid0's_Clan "wikilink") and used as a home and base for
its [members](Lore#Members "wikilink").

## 1st Floor

### Hallway

Along the entire length of the corridor, a path of oak planks runs along
the floor. The right path leads to a glass-enclosed decoration, which is
a kind of fountain of flowing lava. The left path leads to the stairs to
the outside of the 2nd floor.

### DyeXD412's room

The room belonging to DyeXD412. On the left side of the entrance is a
double red bed. After it are 5 double chests with signs labeled "wood",
"stone", "mob loot", "items" and "misc", all filled with name.null, one
in each slot.

Next to them in the corner of the room is an anvil, and against the wall
is an enchanting table, surrounded by 16 bookshelves with cobblestone
slabs on 7 of them.

On the right side of the entrance are two furnaces, the first with
name.null and 13 coal, and the second with name.null and 17 coal. After
them is a crafting table.

In the center of the room is an old-style carpet made of orange and
yellow wool in a checkered pattern.

### Empty room

An empty room that could be rented for 1 iron per day.

### Animals

2 pens, enclosed by oak fences.

The floor of the 2nd pen is made of grass blocks, and in front of the
sign in memory of jagerooo stands a single red tulip.

### Pool

The pool is a room with a water pool enclosed by glass. On the left
side, there are 2 blocks of dirt apart from each other, and in the lower
left corner of the room, there is a chest with a fishing rod with 36/64
durability inside.

The pool is separated from the hall by a 3x3 room.

## 2nd Floor

### Outside

### Clan storage 1

## 3rd Floor

Two player rooms are found here. The one on the right is xXram2dieXx's
room, formerly 0nullvoid0, and the one on the left is WHYER4's room.

## 4th Floor

## 5th Floor

Originally, observed in [WORLD2](WORLD2 "wikilink") to be the Nether
Portal room, it is no longer that. Corrupted blocks called "It" litter
the room like the signs scattered about it. Where the Nether Portal once
was, is the Clan_Void teleportation block called, "431434". Something
foul seemed to have occurred here, but the signs do not help make sense
of the situation witnessed here.
