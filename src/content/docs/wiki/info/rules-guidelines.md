## General Conduct

### Respectful Interaction

- Avoid personal attacks. Focus critiques on content, not individuals, especially regarding any situations about the mod's deletion.

### Consensus Building

- If there are any disagreements regarding page content, discuss them on the relevant Discussion sub-pages or in the official Discord server to reach a consensus rather than engaging in edit wars.

### Voice

- This wiki is manned by a group of anonymous archivists who've come across this fantastic ARG. We operate this site on the budget of a shoestring and a packet of gum. For the sake of maintaining the wiki's voice, keep it in mind that while professionalism is code, approachability is key. Let's try to keep things accessible, casual, and tonally consistent.

## Vandalism

**Vandalism** includes actions like adding nonsense/blatantly fake information to a page, uploading offensive/unrelated images, blanking pages, or spamming unrelated external links. **Such behavior is not allowed, and wiki staff will take action immediately.**

---

## Media and File Usage

### Appropriate Content:

- Ensure that all media files, such as images and videos, are relevant to the wiki's content and do not contain offensive material.

### Reuploads

- Don't reupload existing images on the wiki for the sake of having an edit in your name - this makes file management confusing and takes up unnecessary space.

## Content Guidelines

When creating or editing a page, please follow the guidelines in this section to make this wiki easier to read and more consistent.

### Information

When writing content, before adding any information, consider the following questions:

- Is this addition speculative, such as assumptions or unconfirmed theories?
- Is there no official source for the information?

If the answer to any of these questions is "yes", then the content should not be on the wiki, since even the slightest error can lead to misinterpretation. To avoid misinformation being taken as fact, ensure that all information about lore, entities, and etc. is confirmed either through testing in the mod itself or through statements from **wendigodrip**.

Please be sure to provide evidence on the appropriate Discussion sub-pages for all information added to avoid wasting time on fact-checking. Information added without evidence may be reverted at the discretion of the wiki staff.
