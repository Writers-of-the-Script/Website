title: The Broken Script

import { Kbd } from "starlight-kbd/components";

The Broken Script is a mod haunted by several entities and plagued with technical and visual anomalies. What could occur to one player will be different for the next, almost as though this mod has a mind of it's own. So to say, player experience will vary.

The [Entities](/wiki/entities) that can be found within range from passive to hostile to world corrupting. If not played with the provided/safemode (`/TBS_config` as of 1.9.3) players can be "banned" from their world. It is theorized that the only reason why players have not lost their souls, like the other [victims](/wiki/lore) now trapped inside of The Broken Script, is due to an entity known as [Revuxor](/wiki/entities/revuxor) banning players from their own worlds. Effectively, saving their lives.

What is known about The Broken Script usually derives from inferred information as communications with the Entities within the mod seem limited at best and non-existent at worst. The exception being [Null](/wiki/entities/null) who seems receptive to conversation, but only to a certain degree.

Upon installation of the Broken Script and booting up Minecraft there is already something noticeably off about the client. The usual Minecraft splash texts are ominous at best and threatening at worst, the music that plays on the title screen is eerie and you cannot Quit the game through the menu.

As of 1.9.3 one must <Kbd shortcut="Alt+F4" /> to exit Minecraft.

The reason for this corruption is likely due to [Integrity](/wiki/entities/integrity). Information about said corruption of the Minecraft client can be found in [Lore](/wiki/lore). However, it seems this Void associated creature is not physically present within the Broken Script. Further investigation indicates that Integrity appears to be hidden within another mod called [Spectrum_11](/wiki/spectrum-11). Originally found within the files of the Broken Script, spectrum_11 seems to be missing from 1.9.3. Wendigo has generously provided this extension in his official discord server, however, players are forewarned that spectrum_11 is invasive.

It's by suggestion of this wiki community that players do not open a world with spectrum_11 present in their client.

**Do not play with spectrum_11 unless you are prepared for the consequences of your actions.**

Anomalous behaviour documented after world creation appear to be associated with Minecraft Alpha. The mod is compatible for Minecraft 1.20.1, however cave generation has regressed, and players will very visibly see Deepslate around them being suddenly and rapidly turned into stone. There are no bats, no cats only ocelots, bees cannot spawn even though they're trying to from beehives (if the noise is too much, _'Destroy the Hive_' , get rid of it if you must), and the texture of blocks and food have also reverted to Minecraft Alpha. This is because the corrupted client seems to contain a server that players are connecting to whenever they generate and load into a new world. Whatever world that the server hosted before seems to be desperately trying to recover itself in the new world players have generated.

# Publication History

The Broken Script is seemingly a Minecraft horror mod that has seen a number of controversies. Originally hosted on Curseforge, The Broken Script was already gaining notoriety amongst the modding community for it's unique approach to horror, a notoriety that increased even more after the mod was removed from Curseforge for its ARG-like tendencies.

For those uninitiated, an ARG is an Alternate Reality Game, an interactive narrative that heavily involves audience participation. ARGs are usually marketed as such and to participate in an ARG is to consent in one's own personal involvement with a story's narrative.

The Broken Script is better described as an ARG than a horror mod. It was due to the anomalous behaviour of an ARG, that a few misinformed individuals decided to report The Broken Script 1.8 and have the mod removed from Curseforge. After which it was then moved to Modrinth. The mod has since been brought back to CurseForge.

Version 1.8 did not have what Version 1.9 had. The void's control seemed more severe in version 1.9 and the most severe influence the mod had was the ability to send a command to turn off the player's PC. The command itself is simply the equivalent of pressing the power button, however this action scared a large majority of individuals who wished to play the Broken Script. This fear turned into unwarranted hostility, harassment, and death threats sent towards wendigodrip. Following this, the mod was removed from the public.

Upon further investigation, the 1.9 version of the Broken Script only has the ability to turn off your PC, create a single .txt file in the player's desktop, and Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) pop-ups for [err.sleep](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep).

Video "corruption" caused by the PC shutdown for those recording was not intended, it was simply caused by the recording program not being able to process and save the footage.

After this a community patch was created to prevent the PC shutdown.
