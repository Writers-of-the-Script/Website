## The World They Built. The World They Hate.

<div style="text-align:center;">

_[The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs)_ is a fantastic masterpiece of a horror mod
provided by **wendigodrip**.

This mod is capable of running commands on Windows and Linux systems, creating
text files on desktops and causing Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) Alerts
to pop up during gameplay.

Effectively, _[The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs)_ is an ARG.

The story and atmosphere of _The Broken Script_ is reminiscent of old Minecraft
ARGs and Creepypastas. Most notably that of VoidExp (by mark101). However, _The
Broken Script_ has entities and events of it's own, the story within the Broken
Script is separate from that of Mark101's series.

Frequent questions have answers [here](/wiki/info/faq).
