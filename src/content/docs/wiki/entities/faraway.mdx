title: Faraway
---

Little is known about **Faraway** as they rarely appear.

What is known about Faraway is that it is the only entity that doesn't
try to kick, ban, crash, or otherwise harm players. Even when it is
present near a player they don't prevent players from
[sleeping](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep).

## Appearance

Faraway is a player-like entity best described as a pure white, glowing
void. It looks and feels as though they are "here" but they are not at
the same time.

In some cases it could be observed that their body seems to glitch
(texture clipping).

## Behaviour

### Watching

On rare occasions Faraway will appear within the vicinity of the player
to watch them. Upon approaching Faraway and getting within a 20 block
radius, this entity will vanish and cover the player's screen with a
static-distorted image of the moon's 8th phase accompanied by loud
static.

On rare occasions he will force your camera to look at him.

In multiplayer Faraway will only look at their target player, but they
will disappear all the same if any player approaches them.

Occasionally Faraway will slowly move towards the player if not directly
looked at. If Faraway moves within the radius, it will vanish as usual.
