**Null** is a player-like entity and one of the parts of 0nullvoid0's soul.

His intentions are currently not clear, but according to himself, he wants
freedom.

## Appearance

Humanoid, player-like entity with a solid pitch-black skin.

## Behaviour

Null will join the game (visible in chat) early into the play-through and will
appear in the tab list. After he joins, he can start to appear in the player's
world - usually indicated by a static sound cue and the
[err.null](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep) error message if they try to sleep. Null
can engage in a number of different behaviours, listed below:

### Stalk

Null will appear on the ground and look at the player. Looking directly at him
or getting too close will result in one of seven things happening:

- He vanishes with no other effects.
- He vanishes and deals a small amount of damage to the player.
- He vanishes with a lightning strike where he stood.
- He vanishes and inflicts the player with blindness.
- He sends the player to [Null Torture](/wiki/dimensions/null-torture).
- He switches to Scare behaviour.
- He switches to Chase behaviour.

Occasionally, after disappearing, Null will change the time of day.

### Flying

Null will float in the sky, observing the player. Approaching him by stacking up
or bridging towards him will result in one of the same reactions as with his
grounded form. When he spawns in this behaviour, eerie music will begin playing.

### Endgame

Null will teleport in front of the player, spamming the chat and causing extreme
glitching as "HERE I AM" is spammed across the players' screens, ultimately
turning off their PC.

### Null is here

Null will begin rapidly closing distance with the player, teleporting short
distances towards them. During this text lines flash in the middle of the
player’s screen. Getting hit by Null will ban the player permanently if safemode
is not enabled.

### Chase

Null will chase the player and attack them. During this, the player’s camera
will be locked on him and he will be surrounded by black squares particles.
Getting hit by Null will kick the player with a "null" error message.

Surviving the chase will result in Null switching to his "Null is here"
behaviour.

### Scare

Null will appear in front of the player, jumpscaring them. During this, text
messages will be flashing in the middle of the player's screen. Getting hit by
Null will ban the player from the world permanently if safemode is not enabled.

### Mining

Null will appear somewhere underground with a full set of iron armor and an iron
pickaxe, mining and bridging towards the player. When he damages the player, he
will disappear and play an audio file saying "You will become one of us".

### Nether Mining

It seems that occasionally, Null is also able to appear in the Nether in iron
armor, rapidly mining blocks near the player as well as placing cobblestone
while approaching them. It is currently unknown if his Nether mining behavior
otherwise lines up with his overworld mining behavior; he doesn't seem to chase
the player if they jump into lava and will disappear after a moment. Null's
mining area appears hard to traverse, trapping the player's movement in a way
comparable to the
[ghost blocks area phenomenon](/wiki/mechanics/random-events#ghost-blocks-area).

## Reputation System

There is a reputation system that so far isn't fully understood but it seems to
determine whether Null will give the player gifts and presumably entity/event
spawnrates. There is currently 3 reputation statuses: Good, Neutral, and Bad.

#### Good

So far in this status Null will give the player a chest containing diamonds at
random, its unknown if he can give other gifts in the current version.

#### Normal

Normal conditions but actual effects are unknown.

#### Bad

This status isn't fully understood either but its thought that entity/event
spawn rates increase or get more intense.

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. It's theorized that Null's name reminds him of who he has become, which
    he hates. Notably, he reacts with the same amount of vitriol at the mention
    of xXram2dieXx. 2. There is a popular creepypasta of the same name,
    [Null](https://minecraftcreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Null) However, the one
    from the Broken Script seems to be only related in name. 3. You can glitch
    null by typing "Fuck you" and then pasting "Friend?", you'll need a friend
    for that to do so. The spawned glitched null is named "\[\]" and has a 3
    blocks in height hitbox. 4. Null is confirmed to be 14 years old.
