**Curved** is a player-like entity; formerly a player named [DyeXD412](/wiki/lore). Listening to Disc 13 on loop corrupted him and over time turned him into an entity.

## Appearance

A player-like entity with an oversaturated Steve skin missing his head,
where it would be is a void. Decrepit in posture, Curved stands crooked
and lethargic but walks like a player would otherwise.

He appears to be violently glitching, his model constantly shaking and
visually teleporting around.

## Behaviour

Curved has been reported to spawn underground in caves or mineshafts, he
will stand there until he notices a player within range. Upon detection
he will rapidly advance towards the player in spastic, twitchy,
unnatural pathing movements as he decimates blocks in his way towards
the player. He deals enough damage to one-hit a player even in a full
set of netherite armor.

However, he can be killed, after which he will drop multiple items,
display a kill message in chat, and leave the game shortly after.

He drops the following items on death, although the amounts of each may
vary:

- [Disc 16](/wiki/items)
- Stone Sword
- Stone Pickaxe
- Diamonds
- Iron Ingots
- Rotten Flesh
- String
- Dirt
- Oak Logs
- Oak Planks
- Oak Saplings
- Cobblestone
- Redstone Torches

## Notes

1. Building the Herobrine shrine plays his spawn sound (but doesn't spawn him).
