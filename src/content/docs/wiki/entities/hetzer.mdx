import { Steps } from "@/starlight/components";

## Appearance

A non-Euclidean entity, Hetzer's appearance seems to be reminiscent of
an [Ophanim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophanim).

Hetzer could be best described as a "spheroid" consisting of several
rings encasing a small cube in the centre. It's texture seems to be
white noise.

## Behaviour

Upon approaching Hetzer, within 16-17 blocks of the entity, there are
two possible interactions that could occur:

<Steps>
    1. Hetzer will disappear and false subwoofer lullaby will play for 50
    seconds as time is set to day. Afterwards subwoofer lullaby will end and
    time will be set to midnight. A minute afterwards Circuit will spawn
    disguised as a creeper. 2. Hetzer will disappear and false subwoofer lullaby
    will play for 50 seconds as time is set to midnight. A minute afterwards
    Circuit will spawn.
</Steps>

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. According to wendigodrip, Hetzer teleports in entities for self-defence.
    2. We have no indication of how exactly it occured, but Hetzer was formerly
    _Blackout_. Disc 14 depicts the moments before _Blackout_'s demise.
