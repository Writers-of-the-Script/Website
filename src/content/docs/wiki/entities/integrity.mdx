**Integrity** is an intelligent Void Entity and the main antagonist of
[The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs) and
[spectrum_11](/wiki/spectrum-11). It's heavily implied that
Integrity is ultimately responsible for everything that has occurred as
he is the source of The Broken Script's corruption.

Integrity is the most powerful of all currently-known Void Entities. He
is capable of manipulating game mechanics, such as removing the players'
ability to leave the game and even transforming his victims into
entities.

It is theorized that at some unknown point in time, as early as the
Alpha version of Minecraft, Integrity entered the world and began
waiting for players to join it.

## Appearance

Integrity is a pitch black, slender, wire-like entity standing at about
9 blocks tall. He stands upright and bears a flipped, triangular head.

## Behaviour

Not much is known about this entity. Originally located in spectrum_11,
however as of 1.9, it seems he's joined the others. Unless forced
through chat commands or a command block, there's currently no known
methodology to reach him.

#### Watching

Integrity will appear on the ground and look at the player, waving at
them while his body is split in half.

A ringing bell will signal his appearance.

Getting too close to him will cause one of four things to happen:

1.  He vanishes and teleports the player in his place.
2.  He vanishes and teleports the player in his place, randomly placing
    around bedrock.
3.  He kicks the player from the world with message "You still have some
    time."
4.  He switches to Chase behaviour.

#### Chase

Integrity will chase the player and try to kill them. He's capable of
destroying blocks in his chasing state, and can bridge over the water
with polished basalt towards whoever he is chasing.

#### Endgame

Integrity will play "You will become one of us" voice line and ban the
player from the world with message "Connection terminated: No further
information".

### The Broken Script

Currently, Integrity isn't properly implemented into the mod, its
confirmed more of him will be arriving in future updates of The Broken
Script.

#### Unfinished Boss Fight

Integrity was supposed to have a boss fight in the 1.9 update, however
it was seemingly scrapped after most of the TBS community voted against
it on a poll wendigodrip made on the first official Discord Server.
Integrity's first phase was completed however and it can only be spawned
in by commands.

In phase 1, Integrity will emit static noises and eerie ambience will be
emitted from his location. Integrity will slowly walk towards the player
and has the ability to destroy blocks in his way. He seemingly doesn't
lose agro on the player. He uses the following abilities at random:

**Missiles:** Integrity will summon several black missiles from the sky.
These explode on impact

**Blindness:** Integrity will give the player the blindness status
effect

**Invisibility:** Integrity will turn invisible. In this state he moves
alot faster, to the point where it almost seems like hes teleporting.
When he uses this ability a corrupted voiceline is heard.

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. It is known that he is the "final boss", so to say. As Integrity is
    seemingly the source of all the suffering in [The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs).
    His immediate demise could theoretically be the salvation of the [former
    clan](/wiki/lore)'s souls within [The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs).
