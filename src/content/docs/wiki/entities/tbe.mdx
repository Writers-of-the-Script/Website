**The Broken End** is a seemingly intelligent Void Entity, it could be
easily stated that he harbours only malicious intent towards players. It
is assumed that he works for [Integrity](/wiki/entities/integrity), acting
as an executioner of Integrity's plans, though this is speculation based
off what evidence has been gathered from the Broken Script.

The Broken End is a very powerful and very dangerous entity, allegedly
capable of doing irreversible damage to players by killing them and
taking their souls. He has the ability to prevent players from sleeping
via an [err.endisnear](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep) error, and is capable of
causing a [minecraft.chatengine](/wiki/mechanics/minecraftchatengine)
failure.

It is assumed that the Broken End first appeared on 01.11.2018, his
arrival seemingly caused the server's chat to malfunction. No one was
able to talk to one another, and players were forced to communicate
through signs. Then on 04.11.2018 it ambushed 0nullvoid0, killing him.

## Appearance

A pitch black, wire-like entity. Originally observed in the 1.8 version
of The Broken Script to have a crudely shaped triangular head tilted to
the side with a long and crooked neck. In 1.8 The Broken End stood at 12
blocks tall. However in the 1.9 version of the Broken Script, his height
now stands at a hulking 24 blocks tall. In his calm state, The Broken
End bears a single white eye, and when enraged he has multiple red eyes
that resemble those of [Integrity](/wiki/entities/integrity) and the [The
Moon](/wiki/mechanics/moon)'s 8th phase.

## Behaviour

When The Broken End is spawned a glitchy black artifaction will appear
on the player's screen, through careful means, he could be observed
standing nearby observing the player. Approaching too close to the
Broken End or observing him directly will cause the in-game time to be
set to midnight and one of two interactions to occur:

- If scared away, it will disappear, playing a heartbeat sound and
  giving the player blindness.
- If enraged, it will begin chase with an ear-piercing scream, upon
  reaching the player it takes only one hit to send the player out of
  their own world, effectively banning the player. However, if the
  Broken End is unable to reach the player, the chase will eventually
  timeout and end. In this enraged, chase state, the Broken End is
  capable of breaking blocks.

### Void Holes

Rarely, upon being stared at by the player, The Broken End will
disappear and spawn a "Physical Stacktrace" block in its place that will
slowly eat away at any blocks on the same Y coordinate as it, stopping
their spread once they encounter water or air. Blocks will disappear
down to the void, and it is impossible to break the spreading blocks
unless in creative mode.

- Currently, this behaviour is relatively undocumented and seems to be
  quite rare.

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. If the player types "The Broken End" in chat, Circuit will reply with
    "Administration".
