import { Steps } from "@/starlight/components";

## Appearance

**Sub Anomaly 1** appears to be a "cloud" of black, spastic particles
that has no discernible body or point of origin.

## Behavior

A lot of entities inside of the Broken script, from 'entities' to
anomalies to soul to the creatures of the void have an association with
this appearance that Sub Anomaly 1 takes on. What it is, we cannot say
for certain, as we do not know of it's origins or associations. But it
is theorized that it is some kind of Semi-sentient void Corruption

Seemingly, this cloud of corruption seems to wander mindlessly, with the
intent of approaching a player. When a player is within the cloud it
will inflict damage upon them, generally 1-2 hearts per tick of damage.

Items dropped by the player can disappear if inside the cloud of
corruption.

Sub Anomaly 1 is capable of 'cobblestone bridging' across water, the
width of the bridge seems to range around 6 blocks wide, it's as
unsightly as you can imagine.

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. Like [Random Entity](/wiki/entities/random-entity), Sub Anomaly 1 cannot
    be damaged by players, however it can take damage from other sources, such
    as an iron golem. 2. A fascinating discovery is that Sub Anomaly 1 seems
    capable of killing other entities. A member of our community claims to have
    witnessed two confirmed kills, that being of an instance of Circuit and the
    other of r2. 3. Furthermore, Sub Anomaly 1 one of the very few entities
    capable of fighting back against mobs, currently. 4. Deterrence strategy
    discovered by YouTuber,
    [Auro](https://youtube.com/@auromancy?si=0Jk0CJkhXc97A8D7), is to make a
    bubble column using kelp + soul sand or using magma blocks. Sub Anomaly 1
    isn't capable of replacing water-logged objects, which seems to include
    bubble columns. 5. It's possible to lure Sub Anomaly 1 into a deleted chunk
    by building a bridge for it to follow you on, you can then break the block
    beneath it to make it drop to the void and disappear 6. It's hitbox radius
    is extremely large and can clip through walls, anything behind a wall will
    be killed by Sub Anomaly 1. A recommendation is not to save animals inside a
    box or a small house because Sub Anomaly 1 will eventually kill them.
