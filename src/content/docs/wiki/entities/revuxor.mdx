What is understood about **Revuxor** is minimal, he is rarely seen, as
he's only been observed on very rare occasions.

It has been confirmed that Revuxor was brutally murdered in real life by
[Circuit](/wiki/entities/circuit). This discovery confirms the theory that
the Void, and specifically Circuit, is capable of crawling out into
reality from one's computer. We do not know how or why an image of what
was done to Revuxor seems to exist in TBS now, we do not know if it's an
image or if it's actually parts of his decimated body brought into the
code.

We do not know if he's the only one who suffered such a fate.

The item would be [name.revuxor](/wiki/items), which used to be
pixelated gore. In prior versions it was an indiscernible, zoomed-in,
high contrast red image; Gore.

## Appearance

A player-like entity with a monochrome Steve skin seemingly missing his
eyes.

## Behaviour

One of the more mysterious player-like entities, as Revuxor, in any
instance where the player is going to be banned, he appears behind them
for just 1 tick.

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. It was observed that Revuxor appears behind players in replays of bans.
    2. Asking [Null](/wiki/entities/null) about him leads to him saying "Poor
    soul." 3. Revuxor is titled **thebrokenscript:ban** there's a very likely
    chance that every single time a player's been banned from their world it's
    actually because of Revuxor. He's been banning people to protect them from
    the Void. 4. While desperately searching for information on this entity, the
    wiki staff came across a small Russian horror SMP called SiimpAlone. It
    features a character in it named "[Revuxor
    (Ревуксор)](https://minecraft-siimpalone.fandom.com/ru/wiki/Revuxor)" it has
    no relation to the Broken Script however, this is a fun easter egg from
    where Revuxor's name came from.
