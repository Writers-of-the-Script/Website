**Random Entity** is a player-like entity that can spawn randomly in all
biomes and dimensions.

## Appearance

Humanoid, player-like entity with a purple and black "missing texture"
texture.

## Behaviour

Random Entity will spawn and roam around aimlessly, completely passive
and unresponsive to player attacks. However, other mobs can hurt it.

It's capable of spawning a random entity after an uncertain amount of
time.
