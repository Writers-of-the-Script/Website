title: Notexture
---

Notexture is an entity with the ability to teleport the player to
another dimension if physically interated with, it is seemingly hostile
to a certain degree.

There's little information on him other than what is known of his
behaviour.

## Appearance

Notexture is a player-sized entity with a fractured head - one quarter
of it is missing, and half of it is grown into a branching, antler-like
structure. Its entire body is missing textures, with the usual pink and
black pattern, hence its name.

## Behaviour

Upon spawning, Notexture will start roaming.

Regardless of phase, it will spawn glitched blocks and replace blocks
around it as it moves. These blocks will spread on their own without the
presence of Notexture as well. If at night, it is capable of preventing
the player from sleeping via a [err.texture](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep).

Notexture engages in a number of different behaviours, listed below:

### Roaming

Notexture will aimlessly roam the world, picking a target block to walk
to, then picking another target block, and so forth, until it encounters
a player.

Under seemingly random conditions, Notexture can teleport players to
[Day-A](/wiki/dimensions/day-a).

### Chase

Upon encountering a player, it will begin to run towards them. When
within range, it will vanish and damage the player to half a heart,
despawning. It will also do this when getting to the base of a tower if
the player towers up. Or, as an alternative, it will disappear in a
cloud of black square particles, leaving an item name.null in the
player's inventory.

#### Notes

As of now, contact with Notexture is the only known way to enter [Day-A](/wiki/dimensions/day-a)
