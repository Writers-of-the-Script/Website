**r2**, also referred to as **Siluet**, is one of the more unnerving
entities inside the Broken Script as it is a very obviously humanoid
figure. One who's geometry directly clashes with Minecraft. When r2
is present it causes an [err.soul](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep) error,
preventing players from sleeping.

When r2 spawns it seems to be almost always accompanied by a low-pitched
cave noise

Other than Null, r2 is a pretty common entity and will probably one of
the first entities the player will encounter

## Appearance

A deformed human silhouette with no visible features. Approximately 3
blocks tall, and shakes erratically both when standing still and moving.

## Behaviour

r2 has 10% chance to give the player "Here I am" advancement after
spawning.

### Roaming

This state is the one r2 will appear in the world as. In "Roaming" r2
will either stand still nearby or roam around a small area. Not exactly
passive, just not actively hostile, yet. Looking or nearing r2 in this
state will either make it vanish, or make it go into the Chasing state.

### Chase

Upon direct observation or having a player draw too close, r2 will enter
its Chase mode. It will lock onto the player and charge at them. Being
touched by it will either kill the player and crash their game, or
display screen-wide text saying “CAN’T YOU SEE???”

When chasing, it will cause the chat engine to be
[disabled](/wiki/mechanics/minecraftchatengine).

# He

## Appearance

A rare variant of r2 that looks the same, except the texture is glowing
static instead of darkness. The sprite will shake extremely violently at
all times.

## Behaviour

He will slowly approach the player in a beeline at all times.

Upon getting too close, two known things can happen:

<Steps>
    1. It will transform into regular r2 and proceed to chase the player. 2. It
    will give the player a screen-wide message of "DID YOU SEE IT?" before
    disappearing.
</Steps>

# Notes

<Steps>
    1. Upon spawning for the first time, r2 will give the player the "here I am"
    achievement. 2. r2 has abnormally low health, making him very prone to
    death, particularly at the hands of golems or [Sub Anomaly
    1](/wiki/entities/sub-anomaly-1). 3. r2 can't climb ladders, making height
    bases more reliable when dealing with it.
</Steps>
