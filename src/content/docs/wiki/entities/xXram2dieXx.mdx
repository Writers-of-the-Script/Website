**xXram2dieXx** is a player-like entity and likely a splinter of
0nullvoid0's soul.

## Appearance

Humanoid, player-like entity with what appears to be a default
steve-model that is "corrupted" by shadows.

## Behaviour

### Joining Server

When xXram2dieXx joins the server, the player will be able to find him.
During this time he will speak in chat. If at any point the player
approaches xXram2dieXx he will turn into null and kill the player,
kicking them from their game as well. Doing this seemingly lowers
[Null](/wiki/entities/null)'s favour considerably.

### Dialogue

After breaking a "hello" block, xXram2dieXx will have a chance of joining
the world.

The server will inform the player, "Local game hosted on port [00000]", and
then a little while afterwards, xXram2dieXx will join the game and set
the time to midnight.

He cannot be "interacted" with in chat like [Null](/wiki/entities/null), and
instead he will say the following, encoded in hexadecimal, over a period of time.
Each time he speaks he will set time to midnight and a cave noise can be heard.
After sending all 4 messages, xXram2dieXx will "leave" the game.

| Hexadecimal                                                    | Translation                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `48656c6c6f3f`                                                 | `Hello?`                         |
| `486f772064696420796f7520666f756e642074686973207365727665723f` | `How did you found this server?` |
| `446f20796f752077616e7420746f20626520667269656e64733f0a`       | `Do you want to be friends?`     |
| `4c656176652e`                                                 | `Leave.`                         |

xXram2dieXx joined the game.

## Notes

<Steps>
    1. Seems quite friendly in text. 2. In [WORLD2](/wiki/lore) xXram2dieXx's
    former (or temporary) clan build has a little minecart ride inside of it, it
    is being assumed that xXram2dieXx built it. This little structure is
    entirely impractical, completely useless, loops in a very small 2x2 circular
    rail track... and it's the most adorable thing ever.
