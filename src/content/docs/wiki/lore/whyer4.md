title: WHYER4
---

WHYER4 is a member of [0nullvoid0](/wiki/entities/xxram2diexx)'s Clan. Through
the process of elimination, it can be easily speculated that he was the last
member of the clan to be eradicated or influenced by the void.

## Appearance

There is currently no depiction of WHYER4's appearance. But considering the fact
that [xXram2dieXx](/wiki/entities/xxram2diexx)'s and
[DyeXD412](/wiki/entities/curved)'s skin is very likely default Steve, it
wouldn't be far as to consider him having Steve's appearance as well.

## Personality

From what can be read through signs left around the
[clan_build](/wiki/structures/clan-build), WHYER4 starts his sentences with a
capital letter and often ends them without punctuation, he's seen to use
abbreviations and his writing can come off as a little childish.

## Fate

WHYER4's fate is unknown, we do not know how he died nor if he was even subdued
by the void. However, considering the fates of all the other members of the
server thus far that we know of, it's very likely that he too encountered a
grizzly end at the hands of the void.

There is an unsubstantiated theory, that is only built off assumptions and the
elimination process that theorizes WHYER4 to be "He Who Stood on the Roof of
this Hell" responding with great grievance to one of the void creatures (likely
to be [Circuit](/wiki/entities/circuit) disguised as xXram2dieXx).

This is all mere speculation. It is fanfiction at best, delusional at worst.
However, we are aware of one thing.
