title: xXram2dieXx (Lore)
---

**xXram2dieXx**, also formerly known as **0nullvoid0**, was the leader of
[xXram2dieXx's Clan](/wiki/lore#xxram2diexxs-clan).

## Appearance

xXram2dieXx's exact appearance as a player is unknown, but his
[xXram2dieXx](/wiki/entities/xxram2diexx) entity skin suggests he most likely
used default Steve skin.

## Personality

According to the signs left in [clan_build](/wiki/structures/clan-build) and in
his diary, xXram2dieXx follows the rules of capitalisation and punctuation,
starting his sentences with a capital letter and ending them with punctuation
marks.

He appears to be ambitious or with a strong sense of duty to his clan, as
evidenced by the quote:

`Time to build a base for all of us, the clan must grow.`

## Fate

At some unknown point in time, he, DyeXD412, and WHYER4 started playing together
on the server and formed a clan. They built their first base as it is seen in
[WORLD2](/wiki/lore/world2).

On 02.02.2018 he started a diary where he wrote that after returning from a
two-day break, he noticed that a strange, previously unseen structure had
appeared in the enchantment room. He did not know who put it there, and he only
assumed that it was an admin trolling them.

On 03.02.2018 he wrote in his diary that the structure made a weird sound, and
that his game started to lag a bit. He also jokingly noted that every mob that
gets too close to the structure despawns, attributing it to plugins.

On 04.02.2018 he wrote that it was time to build a base for all of them, because
the clan must grow. It is believed that the base he wrote about eventually
became [clan_build](/wiki/structures/clan-build).

On 04.10.2018 he changed his nickname from 0nullvoid0 to xXram2dieXx, which he
apparently did not tell anyone about beforehand, as he had to clarify it.

On 04.11.2018, after soemone requested more oak wood, he agreed to go get some,
and while he was at it, he was ambushed and killed by
[The Broken End](/wiki/entities/tbe). All of this was somehow recorded on
[Record 15](/wiki/items#record-15).

After his death at the hands of The Broken End, his soul was somehow split into
several parts, each of which seems to have subsequently become a separate
entity. There are currently two known parts of his soul:

- [Null](/wiki/entities/null), a part of his soul that was able to somehow
  retain his original consciousness and memories, thus being classified as a
  [Soul](/wiki/entities#souls) entity.
- [xXram2dieXx](/wiki/entities/xxram2diexx), a part of his soul that exhibits
  only unconscious, mild anomalous properties and is directly tied to the
  [Hello](/wiki/items#hello) block, thus being classified as an
  [Anomaly](/wiki/entities#anomalies) entity.
