**spectrum_11.jar** is a secret secondary mod found within the main mod's files,
and depicts events that chronologically happen before the events of The Broken
Script.

It is suspected to take place somewhere in Alpha Minecraft due to neon green
grass and absence of several mechanics such as hunger and sprinting.

Opening this mod causes all text within the game to become broken and glitched.
Worlds will slowly fall apart. Eventually, the single entity will spawn, being
[Integrity](/wiki/entities/integrity).

The **spectrum_11.jar** is **NOT** present in files of 1.9.3 ver nor in other
1.9 versions currently. For now, you can find it in 1.8 version's files [see
