Want to know what happened to them? Well. It wasn't their fault.
They did nothing wrong. I made them like this because I wanted to.
They had no time to even react. They were just like you. Wandering
around so carelessly and sadly. And I ended it sweetly. I gave them
life. A new life. And now you came here and you know what is going
to happen. Don't worry. It won't be as painful as you think. Just
close your eyes. And wait.
```

## thebrokenendspeech.ogg

Transcrption:

```
Do you know how this happened? We'll tell you then. We dragged
their innocent souls here. For them it all felt real. They tried
to hide in the mine. We felt their fear through the screen. We
blocked their control of the movement and slowly began to move
closer. Tears flowed down their cheeks, but they could not even
cry out in pain. The chat was already corrupted, and we left this
traitor for our last. He saw everything with his own eyes. He begged
us not to hurt his friends. But it was all over for them. And
eventually, for him.
```
