## Goals

We wanted to create an immersive horror experience that is unique and better than any other mod
out there. To do so, we've been steadily creating more and more utilities and tools specifically
for the features in our mod, and we decided to open it up and let people make their own events,
chat responses, entities, and more as addons to the mod. It won't break the experience of the mod
itself, but we feel it's a nice way to let people play the mod as the please and make it the best
experience for them.
