## Setup

The events API lets you easily create your own events by inheriting from the
[BaseEvent](/javadoc/dev/wendigodrip/thebrokenscript/api/event/BaseEvent.html) class.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Kotlin">
        ```kt title="MyEvent.kt"
        package com.example.mymod.events

        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.event.BaseEvent
        import net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity
        import net.minecraft.world.level.Level
        import net.minecraft.world.phys.Vec3

        //              BaseEvent(weight: Int)
        class MyEvent : BaseEvent(1) {
            // level: The level the event was executed in.
            // entity: The entity the event was executed on.
            // pos: The position of the entity, where the event was executed.
            override fun execute(level: Level, entity: Entity, pos: Vec3) {
                // Your code here...
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Java">
        ```java title="MyEvent.java"
        package com.example.mymod.events;

        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.event.BaseEvent;
        import net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity;
        import net.minecraft.world.level.Level;
        import net.minecraft.world.phys.Vec3;

        public class MyEvent extends BaseEvent {
            public MyEvent() {
                super(/* weight = */ 1);
            }

            // level: The level the event was executed in.
            // entity: The entity the event was executed on.
            // pos: The position of the entity, where the event was executed.
            @Override
            public void execute(Level level, Entity entity, Vec3 pos) {
                // Your code here...
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

There are a LOT of utilities in the base class, so I'd recommend taking a good look at the docs!

## Weights

The weight property, which you need to specify when calling the super constructor, determines how
often events are called.

All events have their own weights which determine how often an event is triggered. A higher number
will mean the event is more frequent. The weight must be an integer, meaning you can't use `0.25`
or something like that.

All current events in The Broken Script itself use the weight of `1`. This may change in the future.

<Aside type="note">
    If you're unsure what your weight should be, just make it `1`! It just means
    it has the same chance of being triggered randomly than any other.

## Registration

Don't forget to register the event:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Kotlin">
        ```kt title="MyMod.kt" ins={6,17}
        package com.example.mymod

        import net.neoforged.fml.common.Mod
        import thedarkcolour.kotlinforforge.neoforge.forge.MOD_BUS
        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.registry.RegistryWrapper
        import com.example.mymod.events.MyEvent

        @Mod(MyMod.MOD_ID)
        object MyMod {
            const val MOD_ID: String = "my_mod"
            val REGISTRAR = RegistryWrapper(MOD_ID)

            init {
                // Your code here...

                //              [   ID   ]  [Constructor]
                REGISTRAR.event("my_event", ::MyEvent)
                REGISTRAR.setup(MOD_BUS) // <- Make sure you register everything before calling setup()!
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Java">
        ```java title="MyMod.java" ins={7,18}
        package com.example.mymod;

        import net.neoforged.fml.ModContainer;
        import net.neoforged.fml.common.Mod;
        import net.neoforged.bus.api.IEventBus;
        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.registry.RegistryWrapper;
        import com.example.mymod.events.MyEvent;

        @Mod(MyMod.MOD_ID)
        public class MyMod {
            public static final String MOD_ID = "my_mod";
            public static final RegistryWrapper REGISTRAR = new RegistryWrapper(MOD_ID);

            public MyMod(IEventBus bus, ModContainer mod) {
                // Your code here...

                //              [   ID   ]  [Constructor]
                REGISTRAR.event("my_event", MyEvent::new);
                REGISTRAR.setup(bus); // <- Make sure you register everything before calling setup()!
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip" title="Technical Details">
    Events are registered using the class's constructor. The reason for this is
    because internally, our registry system uses the
    [`DeferredRegister`](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/concepts/registries#deferredregister)
    from NeoForge to perform registration, which allows things to be registered
    at the correct time without us having to hook into the correct events
    manually. The classes you register should only ever be instantiated once
    after registry sync (which happens when you initially join a world or
    server), and therefore can hold temporary state inside them.
</Aside>

After registering, you can test your event using the `/tbs dev event force [id]` command,
but make sure to enable cheats in the config first!

<Aside type="caution">
    Custom events won't be enabled by default in the config. This is a known
    issue and is being worked on for the next update. This is due to the way the
    current config system works.
